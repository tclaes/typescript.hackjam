# Learn How To Write Robust JavaScript Applications With TypeScript

This application is based on Todd Motto Redux-Store apps.

We intentionnally removed some typings and made the application completely fragile to changes.

Your mission is to make this application as strong as possible by typing it the right way.

Before starting, make sure to enable these 2 options inside your `tsconfig.json` file:

- `"noImplicitAny": true,`
- `"strictNullChecks": true`

These 2 options will help you build good habits while working with TypeScript.

## About the application

This application is a simple `todolist`, yes, another one. It's built using vanilla JavaScript.

To start the application, just run `npm install && npm start` or `yarn && yarn start`

Then open your application at `http://localhost:8000`

NB: Even with the amount of errors you have, the application is still working. Once again, your mission is to strongly type your code.

Have fun!
